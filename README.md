# SAP Manager Assistance [Confidential Free]

A desktop automation tool for reminding and demonstrating expired incident information in tree-list structure 
and sending emails for product support managers.

All confidential information has been removed.

In addition, this is not an SAP paid product but a project that I (qianyilun) tried to solve some redundancy issues in my working procedure. Please send me an email (qianyilun@gmail.com) if it is related to copyright or any other issues. I will delete this project immediately.
